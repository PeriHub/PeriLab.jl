abstract = {Abstract This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing additive manufacturing processes. By employing a peridynamic mesh-free implementation, it overcomes certain limitations encountered with finite element-based approaches in regard to defects and fractures. The framework includes the implementation of thermodynamical material behavior and a novel boundary detection algorithm, as the outer surface area will undergo changes during the manufacturing process. The proposed methods are thoroughly validated, and a comprehensive example is provided as a demonstration.}

  abstract  = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a new, rapidly developing technology
	for the mon- itoring of engineering structures. The main features
	are permanent and automatic as- sessment of the structural integrity
	by built-in devices such that non-destructive testing becomes an
	integral part of the structure. Therefore, SHM aims at damage detection
	and loads monitoring by intrinsic means of the structure. The tasks
	can be defined similar to those of conventional non-destructive testing:
	damage detection, localisation and further characterisation. Consequently,
	this leads in an increased safety and a reduction of the maintenance
	costs. Among different approaches, the use of ultrasonic Lamb waves
	is an attractive method for structural health monitoring. Lamb waves
	are able to propagate over large distances, thus wide areas of a
	structure can be monitored. Because Lamb waves sensitively interact
	with defects, they offer a chance for defect detection and further
	characterization. The use of embedded or surface-attached piezoceramic
	elements as actuators and sensors for generation and reception of
	Lamb waves is an attractive way for designing smart SHM structures.
	To gain a better understanding of the physics of Lamb wave, e.g.
	interaction, damages, excitation process, efficient models are needed.
	Furthermore, in future these models can be used to develop and optimize
	an actuator-sensor grid for SHM systems in complex structures, e.g.
	airplanes. Therefore, SHM applications call for both efficient and
	powerful numerical tools to predict the behavior of Lamb waves. The
	mesh density required to obtain good quality solutions has to be
	rather fine both spatial and temporal. This results in enormous computational
	costs (computational time and memory storage requirements) when ultrasonic
	wave propagation problems are solved in the time domain. Furthermore,
	in future design process one has to deal with complex structures.
	To resolve the issue of complex structures the thesis utilize the
	idea of the isogeometric element concept. The isogeometric approach
	utilizes the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) functions of the
	geometrical description of the computer aided design (CAD) software.
	Therefore, no meshing in the todays common way is needed. To model
	the complete SHM structure including actuators and sensors, in this
	thesis a three-dimensional isogeometric piezoelectric finite element
	is developed, tested in several benchmarks and compared to other
	numerical higher order approaches with respect to their ability to
	model Lamb wave propagation problems. The research results are used
	to recommend an optimal discretization scheme. To illustrate the
	advantage of the new iso- geometric finite element two SHM specific
	problems are investigated, namely the dynamic behavior of a piezoceramic
	actuator and the material induced continuous mode conversion. Both
	problems are studied numerically as well as experimentally.},

abstract = {User materials (UMAT) in finite element codes allow the researchers or engineers to apply their own material routines. Simple software interfaces are specified to represent the material behavior in software. In order to use these already existing and often validated models to Peridynamics a UMAT interface is presented. It allows the simplified use of already existing material routines in the peridynamic framework Peridigm. The interface is based on the Abaqus UMAT definition and allows the integration of Fortran routines directly into Peridigm. The integration of already existing UMAT routines based in Peridigm eliminates the need for redevelopment and reprogramming material models from classical continuum mechanics theory. In addition, the same material model implementations are applicable in finite element as well as peridynamic simulations. This opens up new possibilities for analysis, verification and comparison. With this interface many material routines can be reused and applied to progressive failure analysis. The source code is stored in a GitHub repository.}

The generalized peridynamic model for fully coupled thermomechanics is derived using the conservation of energy and the free-energy function. Subsequently, the bond-based coupled PD thermomechanics equations are obtained by reducing the generalized formulation. These equations are also cast into their nondimensional forms. After describing the numerical solution scheme, solutions to certain coupled thermomechanical problems with known previous solutions are presented.}

abstract={Peridigm is a meshfree peridynamics code written in C++ for use on large-scale parallel computers. It was originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories and is currently managed as an open-source, community driven software project. Its primary features include bond-based, state-based, and non-ordinary state-based constitutive models, bond failure laws, contact, and support for explicit and implicit time integration. To date, Peridigm has been used primarily by methods developers focused on solid mechanics and material failure. Peridigm utilizes foundational software components from Sandia's Trilinos project and was designed for extensibility. This paper provides an overview of the solution methods implemented in Peridigm, a discussion of its software infrastructure, and demonstrates the use of Peridigm for the solution of several example problems.},
