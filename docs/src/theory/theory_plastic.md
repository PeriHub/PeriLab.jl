# Plastic models

## Elastic plastic

Plasticity occurs under pure shear load. The included plastic models compute the deviatoric stres part of the problem. This is true for the ordinary state based and correspondence model.

If the shear stress exceeds the yield stress, plastic deformation is computed.
